# LMAL
Single header DSP and audio processing library with a c-idiomatic interface <br />
Current feature set:
 - Convert between linear <-> decibel, seconds <-> samples <-> milliseconds
 - Provides a basic audio buffer datatype
 - Specialised containers for audio processing, such as a Queue, Ringbuffer, and a Zero-padded buffer
 - Interpolated reading from buffers
 - Calculate RMS
 - Read and write LPCM data on disk
 - Windowing functions
 - Complex number arithmetic and FFT
 - Common oscillators such as sine, square, saw
 - Noise generation
 - Obtain amplitude envelope from signal
 - Dynamic range compression
 - Phase modulation
 - Many biquad filters, including lowpass, highpass, allpass, bandpass, notch, peaking, and shelving
 - Delay buffers
 - Amplitude quantization
 - Suite of nonlinear waveshaping functions
